Install Apache Airflow with Docker


Create a folder materials in your Documents

In this folder, download the following file: docker compose file

Open your terminal or CMD and go into Documents/materials

Open Visual Studio Code by typing the command: code .

You should have something like this


Right click below docker-compose.yml and create a new file .env (don't forget the dot before env)

In this file add the following lines

AIRFLOW_IMAGE_NAME=apache/airflow:2.4.2
AIRFLOW_UID=50000
and save the file


Go at the top bar of Visual Studio Code -> Terminal -> New Terminal


In your new terminal at the bottom of Visual Studio Code, type the command docker-compose up -d and hit ENTER


You will see many lines scrolled, wait until it's done. Docker is downloading Airflow to run it. It can take up to 5 mins depending on your connection. If Docker raises an error saying it can't download the docker image, ensure you are not behind a proxy/vpn or corporate network. You may need to use your personal connection to make it work. At the end, you should end up with something like this:
